As most of the data was found to be normally distributed with equal variance, a t-test was used (except for CD8 T Cells where the Mann-Whitney U Test was used). This resulted in the following populations being found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

| Population | p-value  | Test Used | Mean Responders | Mean Non-Responders |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| cd4_t_cell | 0.008351 | T-test    | 36.333333       | 26.333333           |
| monocyte   | 0.033508 | T-test    | 8.0             | 22.666667           |

This suggests that relative frequency of both the CD4 T cells and monocytes are potential indicators of how a patient will respond to treatment tr1. It appears that a higher frequency of CD4 T Cells was found in patients who responded to the treatment, while a higher frequency of monocytes was found in those who did not respond to the treatment.
